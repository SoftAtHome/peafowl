- PFWL_STATUS_IP_LAST_FRAGMENT with that thing that the user should free etc.. is not very intuitive. Better to manage it somehow in the library. Same for PFWL_STATUS_TCP_CONNECTION_TERMINATED.
- In cmake compile demos and l2 parsing only if libpcap is present
- Instead of returning the status and having the dissectioninfo as parameter, we should return the dissectioninfo with the status inside as a field
